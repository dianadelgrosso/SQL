--For this project, I created a jewelry store database.
--I performed analytics on the data using SQL.


--Creating the database:
CREATE TABLE jewelry (
id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, 
name TEXT, 
price INTEGER, 
quantity INTEGER, 
aisle INTEGER, 
on_sale TEXT
);

--Inserting inventory: 
INSERT INTO jewelry VALUES (1, "necklace", 1000, 1, 3, "no");
INSERT INTO jewelry VALUES (2, "bracelet", 750, 4, 1, "yes");
INSERT INTO jewelry VALUES (3, "earrings", 600, 6, 1, "no");
INSERT INTO jewelry VALUES (4, "anklet", 325, 5, 2, "yes");


--ANALYSIS:
--I explored the data using the following SQL:

--First, I wanted to display the database ordered by price.
SELECT * FROM jewelry 
ORDER BY price;

--Then, I wanted to determine the total number of items in each aisle.
SELECT aisle, sum(quantity) 
FROM jewelry 
GROUP BY aisle;

--Lastly, I wanted to know what items were on sale and for what price.
SELECT "name", "on_sale", "price" 
FROM jewelry 
WHERE "on_sale" = 'yes'
